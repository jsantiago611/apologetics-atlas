> If you work on your own, your productivity choices are up to you. But when you involve others in your project, the default should be to honor the habits of the most productive member of the team. -[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2025/04/simple-and-painless-productivity/)

When you lead a team of 15, wasted time can compound pretty quickly. 

1 hour of wasted time turns into 15 hours of wasted time. And when you waste people's time, they don't really want to help you or feel happy to speak to you. And as time zones overlap, the potential for wasted time skyrockets, especially when you need to wait an entire day to get an answer. 

Like Seth outlines in his post [Simple and Painless Productivity](https://seths.blog/2025/04/simple-and-painless-productivity/), here are some proven ways to save hours of wasted time. I've stolen some of his points and added in my opinions and things I've heard: 

-  **Kill the "Could've been an email" meeting**. If a process can be delivered as an email or confluence page, do that instead. Save your time for actual collaborative work like working through blockers and deciding what to sacrifice from your testing. 
- **Lock in meetings** on the calendar. Don't plan a 1-hour meeting when an email or video could have done the job. But when you do need them, block it out in Outlook so you don't lose the time.
- Include some **meeting notes** so you don't all ask each other "what was this meeting for again?"
- Default to a **shared doc** like Confluence instead of sharing random word docs and excel sheets. 
- If you've noticed that the team keeps missing a step in a process, **create a checklist** (and don't forget to put it in a shared doc!). **Remind** them of said checklist. 
- When working across time zones, try to find times that work best for everyone. Start on time, and don't go over. **Use videos for longer messages**, and then when you meet, ask them if they have any questions.
- If you don't an emailed report that takes 30 minutes to put together, kill the report and give back the 30 minutes. 

These are small actions, but when you have a team of 15, you're saving everyone time.
